# Operation-Management-C-Algorithm-Design
In this project, we have to design an algorithm to optimize a factory operation considering the floating material price each day, the storage cost, the startup cost, the initial storage, the productivity capacity constraint, the number of machines, the conversion rates between stations, and so on.
